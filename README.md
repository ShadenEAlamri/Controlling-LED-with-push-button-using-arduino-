# Controlling an LED with a Push Button Using Arduino

## Introduction
This project illustrates how to control an LED with a push button connected to an Arduino board. Pressing the button will toggle the LED on and off, making it an excellent introductory project for understanding digital input and output.

## Required Components
- **Arduino Board** (e.g., Arduino Uno)
- **Push Button**
- **Resistor** (220Ω or 330Ω for the LED)
- **LED** (Light Emitting Diode)
- **Breadboard and Jumper Wires**

## Installation
1. **Connect the Arduino to your computer** using a USB cable.
2. **Download and install the Arduino IDE** if you haven't done so already.
3. **Open the Arduino IDE** and create a new sketch.
4. **Copy and paste the provided code** into the sketch.
5. **Select the correct board and port** from the Tools menu.
6. **Upload the code** to the Arduino.

## Setup Instructions
1. Wire the components according to the following configuration:
   - Connect the push button to the specified pin on the Arduino.
   - Connect the LED to the appropriate pin with a resistor in series.
2. Power on the Arduino and ensure all connections are secure.
